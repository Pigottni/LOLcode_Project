This code was written to lex, parse, and compile an interpreted language called "LOLcode".
To use, run a testcase file outside of the Project folder.

An abstract syntax tree is constructed in the parser based on valid language grammar. 
A compile function was written for each of the nodes in the AST that converts the LOLcode into an intermediate code called "LMAOcode". 
The LMAOcode was then converted to a machine code called ROFLcode.

Complex processes such as loops, functions, and variables are implemented.
